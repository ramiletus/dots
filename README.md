This is my first attempt to program a simple videogame based on JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

The intention is to learn about JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for making basic 2D videogames. I will follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW16Wq1GQjQjpTo_E0taH0La&index=1

After programming the basics, I may be able and motivated to improve the game and experiment with new mechanics.
